dauntel v0.2
-------------------------------

Hello,


This release is rather barebones, as I'm just using it to learn
Ruby.

Configuration takes place at the top of lib/webserver.rb, in the
"config" class.

Make sure you have Ruby installed ( I'm using v1.4.3 ) and start
the server using the "run.rb" script.

It supports the following HTTP request :

GET 

It supports the following HTTP requests :

404/NOT FOUND
500/OK
501/NOT IMPLEMENTED

dauntel only supports sending "text/html".

If the URL the user is attempting to get is a directory within
the defined docroot, dauntel will look for a file named "index.html".

If a file is found, dauntel sends back :

--

HTTP 1.1 500/OK 
Content-type: text/html 

--

followed by the content of the file.

If the directory or filename is not found, or if no index.html
exists dauntel will send back :

--

HTTP 1.1 404/NOT FOUND
Content-type: text/html

Sorry, that file was not found on this server.

--

Finally, if the user attempts to send any request except GET, dauntel will
send :

--

HTTP/1.1 HTTP 1.1 501/NOT IMPLEMENTED
Content-type: text/html

Sorry, that method is not implemented on this server.

--


That's it for now! :)
