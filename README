dauntel v0.3
-------------------------------

This release is rather barebones. A list of items to get
to 1.0 is in doc/TODO

Make sure you have Ruby installed ( I'm using v1.4.3 ) and start
the server using the "run.rb" script.

Configuration takes in etc/config.rb

It supports the following HTTP request :

GET 

It supports the following HTTP responses :

404/NOT FOUND
500/OK
501/NOT IMPLEMENTED

dauntel supports mime types, and comes with a mime.types file
in etc/mime.types ( the location of this file is configurable
in etc/config.rb ).

If the URL the user is attempting to get is a directory within
the defined docroot, dauntel will look for any of a number
of index files, set in etc/config.rb

If a file is found, dauntel sends back the appropriate content-type
based on the extension ( mime-type ) of the file, followed by the 
content of the file.

If the directory or filename is not found, or if no index file
exists dauntel will send back :

--

HTTP 1.1 404/NOT FOUND
Content-type: text/html

Sorry, that file was not found on this server.

--

Finally, if the user attempts to send any request except GET, dauntel will
send :

--

HTTP/1.1 HTTP 1.1 501/NOT IMPLEMENTED
Content-type: text/html

Sorry, that method is not implemented on this server.

--


That's it for now! :)
