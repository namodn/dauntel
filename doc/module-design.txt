* Defined module types:    content, auth

Module Type: Content
--------------------

 * If module is loaded, it registers itself as a 'content handler' for certain
   extentions.
   Examples:
     - module 'cgi' would register itself as a content handler for '.cgi'.
     - module 'dir' would register itself as a content handler for '/'.

 * When webserver.rb is trying to get the requested file, it will check with 
   the content handler. If no content type is registered with the file in 
   question it will pass it on to mime types, and display the file.

 * If the content type _is_ found for the filename in question, the module 
   registered for that content type will generate the contents of what to 
   display, and return it to the webserver (which will display it as is).
   Examples:  
     - thingy.cgi would mean the module 'cgi' would be executed to handle that 
       file. It would execute the CGI and return the output.
     - anything with a '/' at the end would mean the module 'dir' would be 
       executed. It would return a listing of the directory.
